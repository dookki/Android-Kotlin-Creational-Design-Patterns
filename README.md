Zero To Hero in Android Kotlin Creational Design Patterns
By Ali Baha

Design patterns are a set of solutions to common software development problems that have been proven to be effective through years of experience. In the world of Android development, these patterns can be especially useful when working with the Kotlin programming language. This article will explore some of the most popular design patterns used in Android development with Kotlin. We will also explore how they can be implemented to improve the structure and organization of your code. From the SOLID principles to the Gang of Four patterns, we will delve into the best practices for designing your Android apps using Kotlin and the power of design patterns.

These patterns are divided into categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

How can they be useful?
In general, creational design patterns provide solutions for creating objects in a structured and organized manner. They can be used to promote loose coupling, allow for easy modification, allow for code reuse, simplify object creation and improve performance. Each pattern has its own strengths and weaknesses and should be chosen based on the project's specific requirements. Itâ€™s important to understand each pattern's trade-offs and potential drawbacks before choosing one to use in your application.

Creational patterns
Creational patterns focus on object-creation mechanisms and aim to create objects in a manner that is suitable to the situation. In this article, we will explore the Creational design patterns and how they can be used to improve the structure and organization of our code. By understanding these patterns and their implementation, developers can make more informed decisions when designing and building their software projects.

Factory Method
The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It defines a method for creating objects, which subclasses can then override to change the type of objects that will be created.

Popularity: ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¢

The structure of the Factory Method pattern typically includes the:

Product: An interface or abstract class that defines the type of objects that will be created. This interface or class defines the methods that all objects created by the factory method must implement.

ConcreteProduct: Classes that implement the Product interface or inherit from the abstract Product class. These classes define the specific type of objects that will be created by the factory method.

Creator: An abstract class or interface that defines the factory method. This class or interface defines the method that subclasses will use to create objects.

ConcreteCreator: Classes that implement the Creator interface or inherit from the abstract Creator class. These classes provide the implementation of the factory method and determine the specific type of object that will be created.

In this example, Product is the interface that defines the methods that all created objects must implement, ConcreteProductA and ConcreteProductB are classes that implement the Product interface, Creator is the abstract class that defines the factoryMethod and ConcreteCreatorA and ConcreteCreatorB are classes that provide the implementation of factoryMethod.

Here is a real-world implementation of the Factory Method pattern in Android:


The Factory Method pattern is good for several reasons:

It promotes loose coupling: By encapsulating the process of creating objects in a separate factory class, it allows the client code to remain unaware of the specific classes that are being instantiated, promoting loose coupling between the client code and the objects it uses.
It allows for easy modification: Because the factory method is defined in an interface or abstract class, it can be easily overridden by subclasses to change the type of objects that are created. This makes it easy to modify the code to create different types of objects without affecting the client code.
It allows for code reuse: By encapsulating the process of creating objects in a separate factory class, it allows for code reuse across multiple classes. This can lead to a more organized and efficient codebase.
It simplifies object creation: By encapsulating the process of creating objects in a factory class, it can simplify the creation of complex objects, making it easier to create and manage them throughout the lifetime of the application.
It supports the Open-Closed Principle: The Factory Method pattern allows new objects to be added to the system without modifying existing client code, it supports the open-closed principle which states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Abstract Factory
The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It uses a set of factory methods, each of which creates a related object of a specific class.

Complexity: ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¢ âšª

Popularity: ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¢

The structure of the Abstract Factory pattern typically includes:

AbstractFactory: An interface that defines the factory methods for creating objects. These methods return objects of the Product interface.

ConcreteFactory: Classes that implement the AbstractFactory interface. These classes provide the implementation of the factory methods, creating objects of the ConcreteProduct classes.

Product: An interface that defines the type of objects that will be created by the factory methods.

ConcreteProduct: Classes that implement the Product interface. These classes define the specific type of objects that will be created by the ConcreteFactory classes.

In this example, AbstractFactory is the interface that defines the factory methods, ConcreteFactory1 and ConcreteFactory2 are classes that implement the AbstractFactory interface, ProductA and ProductB are interfaces that define the methods that all created objects must implement, ConcreteProductA1, ConcreteProductA2, ConcreteProductB1 and ConcreteProductB2 are classes that implement the ProductA and ProductB interfaces.

The Abstract factory pattern is closely related to the factory method pattern. The main difference is that the factory method creates objects of a single class, while the abstract factory creates objects of multiple classes. The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.

Here is an example of a real-world implementation of the Abstract Factory pattern in Kotlin Android:


Both Factory Method and Abstract Factory patterns are good for creating objects in a structured and organized manner, but they are tailored for different needs. The Factory Method pattern is good for creating individual objects, while the Abstract Factory pattern is good for creating families of related or dependent objects. Both patterns have benefits and trade-offs and should be chosen based on the specific requirements of the project.

Builder
The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. It is used when an object has too many fields or its construction process is complex.

Popularity: ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¢

The structure of the Builder pattern typically includes:

Builder: An interface that defines the methods for building the parts of the complex object.
ConcreteBuilder: A class that implements the Builder interface. It provides the implementation of the methods for building the parts of the complex object and also keeps track of the constructed object.
Director: A class that uses the Builder interface to construct an object. It defines the construction process but does not know the concrete classes of the Builder or the object being constructed.
Product: The complex object that is being constructed.
Here is an example of the structure of the Builder pattern in Kotlin:


In this example, Product is the complex object that is being constructed, Builder is the interface that defines the methods for building the parts of the complex object, ConcreteBuilder is a class that implements the Builder interface and provide the implementation of the methods for building the parts of the complex object, Director is a class that uses the Builder interface to construct an object and defines the construction process.

Here is an example of a real-world implementation of the Builder pattern in Kotlin Android:


The Builder pattern is good for several reasons:

It allows to create different representations of the same object: The Builder pattern allows to create different representations of the same object, this can be very useful in situations where the same object needs to be constructed in different ways.
It supports the Single Responsibility Principle: The Builder pattern separates the construction process of an object from its representation, this way the class that defines the object only has to worry about the representation, and the Builder class only has to worry about the construction process. This helps to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.
Prototype
The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows objects to be created by copying existing objects, rather than creating new ones from scratch. It is used when creating a new object is either expensive or impossible.

Complexity: ðŸŸ¢ âšª âšª

Popularity: ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¢ âšª

The structure of the Prototype pattern typically includes:

Prototype: An interface that defines the clone() method, which creates a copy of the object.

ConcretePrototype: A class that implements the Prototype interface. It provides the implementation of the clone() method, which creates a copy of the object.

Client: A class that uses the Prototype interface to create new objects.

The Prototype pattern is good for several reasons:

It reduces the need for subclasses: When creating new objects based on existing ones, the Prototype pattern reduces the need for creating subclasses to instantiate new objects, this can simplify the codebase.
It improves performance: The Prototype pattern improves performance by avoiding the overhead of creating a new object from scratch. Instead, it creates a copy of an existing object, which can be faster and less memory-intensive.
It allows for dynamic object creation: The Prototype pattern allows for dynamic object creation, this can be very useful when the type of object that needs to be created is not known until runtime.
Singleton
The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to this instance. It is used when a single instance of a class needs to coordinate actions across the system.

Complexity: ðŸŸ¢ âšª âšª

Popularity: ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¢ âšª

The structure of the Singleton pattern typically includes:

Singleton: A class that implements the Singleton pattern. It has a private constructor and a static instance variable that holds the single instance of the class. It also has a static method (often called getInstance()) that returns the single instance of the class.
Here is an example of the structure of the Singleton pattern in Kotlin:


In this example, Singleton is a class that implements the Singleton pattern, it has a private constructor and a companion object that holds the single instance of the class and a static method getInstance() to return the single instance of the class.

This is the most basic implementation of a singleton pattern, but itâ€™s not thread-safe. It is also possible to use other thread-safe methods of implementing a singleton such as using synchronized keywords, double-checked locking, using an enum, and using a static block.

Here is a more real-world implementation of the Singleton pattern in Kotlin Android:


The Singleton pattern is good for several reasons:

It improves performance: By reusing the same instance of a class, the Singleton pattern can improve performance by avoiding the overhead of creating new instances of a class.
It controls concurrent access: The singleton pattern can be used to control concurrent access to a shared resource, this is useful in situations where multiple threads are trying to access the same resource simultaneously.
It helps to maintain the state of an object: By ensuring that thereâ€™s only one instance of an object, it helps to maintain the state of an object across multiple requests.
